Test versions are used to check if a major change can be deployed. Use them carefully and please raise issues if necessary.


Test version V1.2.9 is portable (no installer). Just unzip the file where you want and run 'Power BI Sidetools.exe'

If you want to add icons in 'External tools' ribbon, open the 'External tools manager' from Sidetools menu. Then open the wizard and select 'individual tool' at the 'Action' step. You may also modify the .pbitool.json included files changing the path and move these files to external tools folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\Power BI Desktop\External Tools).
